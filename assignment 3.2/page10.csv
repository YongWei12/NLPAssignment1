"10","R2Q4EIXF10KRWM","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020","Rob Goblin","4","Plug and play","As a long time Nintendo gamer I've learned to never purchase third party equipment if you want it to function and not waste money. This isn't the cheapest option but it is plug and play after a system restart while other cards have a more lengthy and frustrating process. I wish it wasn't so much but that's the price you pay with Nintendo."

Perfect for more download games.","I thought it was exspensive when i bought it, but after installing it i see why it was $53. I could fit the games from 10 or 20 switches onto this memory card.Worth every penny. After seeing its speed and storage i would value this at $65. Glad i got it. Pokemon games take up a lot of room, even without the dlc."

I was able to insert it into my switch but it was unable to be recognized by the system. My switch was updated and I restarted it several times but an error code kept appearing. Very disappointed."

Once we put this in, we installed a ton more games which is important for our YouTube channel OHLR Arcade. We actually bought the official Nintendo memory card in an electronics store for 4X the price and it didn't fit, so we returned that and purchased this one on Amazon instead."

I bought this a while ago and it still works, all 128 gigabyte where there, well except for the few it uses but thats completely normal. I was sceptical at first but I bought it anyways. A lot of micro sd cards seem to be fake here on Amazon but this one is 100% real. I even bought a 64 gigabyte one later because its trustworthy.This micro sd card is not limited to just the Nintendo Switch. I used it for my ps vita thanks to sd2vita and It works just as expected. Probably the only micro sd I will ever buy now."

Manator","4","There are cheaper versions they all work the same.","It works.I often wonder why I didnt go buy 2 64gb cards for 21$.Because it wouldve saved me 12$.But I was cautious of using a non nintendo product for various reason so I spent the extra money.It reads fast it writes fast and I can stop archiving my games now. Plenty of room for what I need."
"","R1YF67VBR7ED6Q","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2020","L. Stillwell","5","Worked perfect","After reading other reviews I made sure this was ships and sold by amazon before purchasing. I didn’t want to do a bunch of research on sd cards, so seeing that this was endorsed by Nintendo made it an easy pick for me. I was able to install into my Nintendo switch and begin downloading games right away."
"","RWGK01LHAUMDJ","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2020","jillholiver","2","disappointed.","I ordered this out of necessity for my Switch. I bought the 256 GB card, knowing I would need the extra space. It was obviously brand new in its package, which was sufficiently protected. However, I loaded the SD card in my Switch only to find that the capacity read as 238 GB. 18 GB may not seem like a huge deal, but for 50+ dollars, I expected the capacity I paid for. I'm super disappointed. I wouldn't have bought this product had I known the capacity wasn't what was advertised."
