I tried putting it in properly, turning the Switch on and off, trying it in my computer, ..it simply is a dead sd card"

"","R2HNSKV6UTN5QO","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019","Jack T.","5","Great card!","I got the 128GB version of this MicroSD card, and it works like a charm! Yes, I know you pay more for the same storage just because there's a Nintendo logo slapped on the card, but after reading so many reviews about fake cards, I figured these are more likely to be authentic. Looks like I was right too, I ordered two of these and H2testw confirmed both are perfectly fine. Paying an extra $5 is worth the peace of mind. One more thing, yes, the actual formatted capacity is 119GB. That's completely normal. Lastly, make sure the item you're buying is shipped and sold by ""Amazon.com Services, Inc"" and not a third party seller. Anywho, couldn't be happier with my purchase!"
"","R1G97OSSZP6U4K","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2019","Milly ","1","Product was defective upon arrival","Dont Buy! For some reason I'm having to write another review because the original one I posted seemed to some how dissapeare. The microSD simply did not work. I continously got an error telling me to restart my switch and reinsert the SD card but it didn't work. I then used a a different microSD card I had laying around which worked perfectly with my switch. When I instered this microSD into my computer it wouldn't even detect it! The most frustrating part was the 10-15 minutes speaking to a SanDisk representative. After using the technical support rep with amazon, they were able to patch me through to a tech with SanDisk. After going over a some trouble shooting steals the rep determined the microSD card was defective. She asked for my email and number so she could email me instructions on how to send this one back and get a new replacement. I know got an email or any further instructions on how to replace the defective product I got from SanDisk. Ultimately I decided it was not worth the hassle and returned the item to Amazon for a full refund."
