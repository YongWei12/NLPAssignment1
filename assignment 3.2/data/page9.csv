"9","R2683D87EJT7H3","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020","David Hanna","5","Does the job!","I got this for my girlfriend and her Nintendo Switch.I mostly got this because of problems people have had in the past with SanDisk and overheating, so I figured this was the safest bet for someone else.And it works! Looks cool too, with the Nintendo logo. I suggest this for anyone looking for that extra layer of security by both SanDisk and Nintendo."

Definitely a no brainier add on to the switch. 128 GB is plenty of space, you're already spending $300 + on a console, DON'T CHEAP OUT on the sd card and lose your games or corrupt your saves!"

Hey Nintendo remember you need I’d customers more than we need you .Anyway the card itself is fine but I could put a 400 gig card made by same company for a little over $40.00 just doesn’t have Nintendo’s over priced name connected to it"

My card is 128gb which I find is the sweet spot for the amount of games that I have. I do recommend this card but it is a little bit pricey just for the little graphic that it has on it but if you can get it on sale like me it is well worth it!"
"","R2G5KHADG8YEYP","Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2019","Ronnie","5","A little goes a long way","This is great for those of us who don't download all of our games, I'm more into physical versions of games. The only complaint I have is that it not exactly 64 GB it's actually 59.4 GB but honestly I probably won't end up filling it anyway. As you can see by my pic I have only used 14.7 GB of the I internal memory and I have 17 titles on there already, so you should feel confident that this will be enough for the average gamer."
"","RLX6LJWLC6XFP","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020","CH","5","Works!","I do not know why I waited this long to get this (I had been archiving games to keep space open on my Switch). This is a small SD card and works great with my switch. You do need to put the ""kick stand"" up on the switch to see where the port is to insert it (I had to look it up). No complaints and pleased with this purchase!"

When its plugged into my switch it reads error message 2137-7500 which doesn't even exist. if my switch ends up failing for no reason in the future I know why. DO NOT BUY THIS CHIP. Absolute trash...just buy a normal sandisk chip."

It’s dramatically increased the storage capacity on my Nintendo Switch. I can now play all the games that I have purchased over the last few years without having to archive and redownload. I know it’s a bit pricier then other SD cards but I love the reassurance that it will work with my switch and that it has some Nintendo flair. My only complaint is that I could not transfer the files from one SD card to another using my Mac, so I had to redownload all of my games which took hours to complete. My guess is it’s more a Mac problem then an SD card problem. It’s been a great upgrade and well worth the money."

I was torn between this one and the Samsung SDs but essentially decided to go with this one because of all the fake cards going around now days. No configuration needed. Just plug it in and you are good to go."
"","R14S911CIHPLVH","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020","Jon Cox","5","Great licensed storage upgrade for Switch!","After using a 128GB Sandisk Extreme micro sd for Switch, I wanted to go all the way & get the Nintendo licensed 256GB one. Games seem to run a little smoother & lets not forget about doubling my storage! Plus,I personally like how Nintendo put a different image stamp on each size SD card. Price is a little more expensive, but you are paying for the name..."
