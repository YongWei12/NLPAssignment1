"7","R2E2QMKL3RC0A2","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020","T","1","Fake card. Stopped working after a week.","I recently received a Nintendo Switch as a present and Animal Crossing along with it. When the Switch's system memory filled up with screenshots, I was compelled to buy a microSD to continue saving screenshots for the game. When the package arrived, the card immediately went into use on the Switch. Didn't take it out or do anything out of the ordinary with it. After a week, I keep getting the error ""Unable to access SD card"". Tried re-seating the card in the slot, turning off/resetting multiple times, reformatting. Nothing worked.After extensive googling for solutions, there were mentions of fake SD cards on Amazon, so I took a closer look at the packaging that I barely glanced at in my excitement. It definitely seems fake since the seal between the two cardboard pieces indented on places where text was printed on, and there is color clipping on the edge of the package where there shouldn't be any..I've barely made a dent into the supposed 128 GB of storage, and now I'm left with no way to retrieve my data and out $30. I'm hesitant to initiate a return since I have saved data on this card that cannot be erased on my part, so in short.. I'm mad. >:("

With this officially licensed product I know it’s going to work seamlessly, with proper data transfer speed. Plus it’s has a cool Nintendo graphic printed on it! Ordering from amazon was cheaper than in stores."

"","R1NHSJ5P8VY8P8","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2019","BestBadger","5","Best Value SD Card","The product arrived fast and worked great with my Nintendo Switch! The SD card fits in a small slot right underneath the stand that's located on the backside of the switch. After carefully 'clicking' into place, the system recognizes it immediately and prompts a system update. It was a quick and easy solution for the limited space the switch contains. I would definitely buy again if I need another one!"

The cards memory is worse than my drunk grandmas. Saved images disappear from the I album only to reappear out of order.. I’ll edit a video and then end up with three copies of the original and none of the trimmed vids. Not to mention the advertised space seems to be a huge exaggeration. I have one game on the console I have the card in, AC’s new update musta been a hefty one, because 65 sceeenshots and 11 videos (15seconds each avg) later and my storage is MAXXED OUT...?? Unreal. Typical, just outlived it’s return window.Tl;dr DONT WASTE YA TIME OR MONEY, HONEY 😋"

However, I did buy the 256GB disk for our Nintendo Switch and it actually had 283 GB, so that's a nice surprise.I generally buy brand name electronics rather than risk under-performing off brands.With that in mind, I'm plenty pleased with the performance of this disk and have no regret spending a few extra $ on this vs other options."

Naturally I know it doesn't have to be Nintendo theme card you can use others that meet the requirements. However I used this one just to be safe. Oh yes it works perfectly, all my data remains safe and successfully transferred."
