There are plenty of others out there from different brands and higher storage for a cheaper price, but there are also plenty of fake ones lurking about. Some have shown to have fried their gadget. Be safe and just get this brand that you trust for your gadget, even if this just has a mushroom and a nintendo logo on it, it is worth it. It only cost a few more dollars than the other brand but it performs pretty well. If you do research on this, it's pretty fast when you use it on there gadgets due to it's specs. My pc recognizes it quickly and it performs flawlessly. Despite not seeing this when you plug it in your gadget, it's still a pretty cool looking sd card with a power up mushroom.This use to cost a lot but it went down to a reasonable price.Overall if you find this on sale, get it. it's definitely worth it. Don't listen to what others say, it's your choice to pick something that you think looks cool and will keep your gadgets protected. I wish they had a gold one with the Zelda Triforce, to make it look even more awesome for like a 1 tera."

I am not disappointed. It cost me $10 more but I can rest easy knowing my files will not be corrupted by a fake micro SD card. The one criticism is that it actually only has 59.4GB of storage. Not the full 64 as advertised. This wasn't a big deal for me though because I am using this card to transfer files, not because I need a lot of storage. Fit easily into my Switch Lite and was instantly recognized. An added bonus is that the card looks really cool with the Zelda design!"

"","RB4DV13CFV7O4","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020","XV123","3","Good card but problems","I have never had problems with this brand before and have used many of their cards in my Switch systems.However, this particular card has been a problem.Everyone of my game in my collection (digital and physical) became corrupt. You are talking over 35 physical games and probably 25 to 30 digital games.I'm not sure what happened.I basically, had to delete all data on the card while it was in the switch and reinstall every game to get them to work. I am not sure if this has fixed my physical games for good or not.It would be a shame to lose that size of a game library over 1 memory card.At this point I would have to turn away from the Switch and go back to PC and PS4.Sorry Nintendo."

However, I find this one works really well. And I have downloaded a healthy supply of games, both big and small in size and I have a lot of space left. Before coming to the switch, i had a playstation vita, and you gain a whole new appreciation of memory space once you get away from Sony and their ridiculous prices. So well played to you Nintendo.That said, when you Google search which is the best memory card to buy for the switch, it's not this one. There are other options available and there are better prices too, especially when they go on sale. I haven't really bothered to look into it too much, because, as I said before, I was just happy to find a large memory card at a decent price.It really does depend on how many games you expect to download. Playing games and collecting games seem to be two different pass times for some people. You just need to decide, of the two, which type are you."

I tried to download some of my games to it and it keep saying data corrupt. I check it with ChipGenuis and it said it was generic. So I checked with H2testw and it showed 91.8gb was corrupted. I don’t know if they are all bad but this one was. It’s up to you if you wanna take a chance. I’m just gonna get them from Walmart or GameStop now."

According to them, the SD card I received from amazon was not an actual Sandisk product. It was some kind of counterfeit knockoff that looked the part. That's why it didn't work. So I'd suggest you steer clear of this product.(Original Content)At first I thought I had an issue with a new game, then life got busy and I shelved the system for a couple months out of frustration. I decided to pick it back up over the holidays and tried to problem solve the issue. Turns out it was 100% this SD card. I took it out, restarted my system, made a few downloads to replace the data on the card, and suddenly I was completely error free. My kids can finally play Minecraft again, but I'm out $30."

You don’t have to format this SD card since it’s made for the switch. I like the card a lot but it did however only show 119GB!! I thought i bought 128GB. I’m curious to know where the other 9GB went..."
"","R15M1R44GARBLA","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020","SnowChild","5","Works great but..","Other then the price it’s great the only reason to get it is according to other micro SD reviews the switch can’t properly be saved on them and can even end up corrupt or not work with the switch anymore. If you are willing to chance a malfunction try a cheaper option for sure but due to me needing something that I know would work and being limited on money I chose to be extremely safe and buy this. I know I could have chanced it but it was already going to take a few weeks to get here and I wanted to have something to download Minecraft on sooner rather then later. This was isn’t specifically bad in price I guess but I was thinking of getting bigger storage and man it spikes high for even 2x the storage of this one I got the 64 GB."
"","R3GXAYMPVL63UN","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019","Iris","5","Buy if you want but be aware that there is cheaper options","I bought this microSDXC card for my switch, it works for what it’s attended for and came in perfect condition so no complaints here. The only reason I bought this one specifically is because I thought the star was cute and that I might as well go overkill on the amount of Gb the SD card has. Though if you want one with smaller space they do have a Nintendo licensed mushroom SD card with 128 Gb that I think is $30. I gave this sdxc card a 4/5 stars for value for money because to be real there are cheaper SD cards out there with the same amount of space that aren’t Nintendo licensed but if money isn’t a problem it’s nice to get this cute Mario themed SD card for your switch."
