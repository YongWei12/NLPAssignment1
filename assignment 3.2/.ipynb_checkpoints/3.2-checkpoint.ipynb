This SD card came in clutch, it\\'s got a Nintendo switch logo, is fully endorsed, and was a lot cheaper than namebrand. I knew I could not go wrong in till this day, my switch is functioning like a dream. If you already made an investment in a switch, go the extra mile and purchase the extra memory for it, you\\'re going to need it.\"},{\"id\":\"R3TRJPKYZB7RSG\",\"review_data\":\"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2019\",\"name\":\"Zach \",\"rating\":5,\"title\":\"It’s about as good as this could get\",\"review\":\"I’m assuming you’ve downloaded a couple games directly to your switch and your not buying games physically/ downloaded warframe and it’s taking all of your space like me it was confusing at first where to put this tiny SD card (smaller than a penny) but I’ll help you guys out if you don’t know already the stand on the back of your switch hides the slot for the card so flip your stand up and slide it in like the picture on your switch shows you and make sure it clicks in just like how you would put a game inNote: you paid for 128 GB of storage but your switch still has to configure it to make it compatible so that’ll take some storage this happens to every kind of storage unit on almost any device you use so your really buying 120-119 of storage at least that’s what mine is left with\"},{\"id\":\"RK617YRBTWOBF\",\"review_data\":\"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2019\",\"name\":\"david vargas\",\"rating\":5,\"title\":\"Perfect add-on for the Nintendo Switch and \\\\\"The Legend of Zelda\\\\\" Fans!\",\"review\":\"Nicely customized,\\\\\"The Legend of Zelda\\\\\" SanDisk SD memory card for the Nintendo Switch,64 GB,Offically Licensed Nintendo Switch merchandise.Smaller than a U.S. dime $0.10 coin.originally Priced at $19.99 USD..got this item for $17.00 USD for being a Amazon Prime member,with free 2-day shipping and handling!

Exactly what one needs to have more space on a single device!! However you do not get 128GB as it’s advertised. You get about 118GB total . (I took the pic after downloading a few games and demos) I’m sure the other 10GB goes towards space needed for the device to recognize the SD cardor for it to configure to the switch (I’ve got no idea just guessing ) but I’d much prefer it to advertise the 118GB of actual space that you get . I’m also not sure why it saves things to the SD card when there is available space on the Switch. I suppose it’s so that the Switch doesn’t get bloated then start to run slower or some other valid reason but it just means that if you ever remove the SD you might loose the games or at the very least have to re-download them to the device. You can get past this by removing the SD before makingcertain downloads and get more control of what gets saved to the device VS the SD card , but I’m not that anal about it. The Switch does tell you where your downloads are saved via a blue hi-lighted section (See pictures ). Still give 5 stars because I’m not THAT mad . Just thought I’d share for those who are more literal with things and don’t like to be misled.\"}]}'"
