9045 upvotes,

1005 downvotes

and 420 comments!
Reminds me of the Tom Scott video where his title is his current view count. Was this inspired by his video?
Good job. But honestly, add a sleep timer of a few seconds. This will eventually get your IP banned on reddit if you bombard them with too many requests.
Cool! Could you share it?
This is awesome. I want to just upvote it but I can't resist upvoting, refreshing, downvoting, refreshing ad infinitum.
how often does it refresh? seems like it's changing quite a bit!

I wonder how many refreshes it has...

I wonder why the real upvote net total is 1 more than the displayed message. Did you round up or down somewhere?

Here I am toggling the upvote and downvote buttons to see it change. I love this
yo who are the 300-350 ish people downvoting this? this is fucking cool
Are you just scraping the page every so often and edit the post? Can you edit posts.....I dont think you can.
Yes
Cool!
I hate that the tester in me had to upvote and down vote multiple times to watch the counts. Definitely not commenting to see the count jump to 150 either.
Ass
This is sick
Okay this is pretty cool

This is really ducking cool.
am i the only one who sees a higher number of upvotes in the post than the amount that the reddit app shows me edit: forget is, i forgot to subtract downvotes

Wait if you create a statistic from the amount of karma and the amount of upvotes/downvotes, over time maybe you could find out the sacred karma algorithm..
222 ya punk
No it doesn't
THAT IS SO COOL

But how does it work... It doesn't say edited on it...
Lol
This feel oddly simular to braking the 4th wall, but this situation is not called that... unless it is? Cyber wall? breaking the Cyber wall? I don't know. It's cool though.
