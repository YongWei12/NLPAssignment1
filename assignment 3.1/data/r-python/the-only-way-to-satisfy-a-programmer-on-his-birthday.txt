The indentation will make him cry again
Tabs or spaces?


No
Could also have put ‚ÄúHappy Birthday to ‚Äú into a variable to avoid repeating the text multiple times in the code.

name.capitalise() could go directly in the print statement as it‚Äôs only used once.

No error handling.

Frankly this needs a ton of work. At present it's totally half baked.
I'd say the lack of white space would piss me off, but in this context that doesn't really make any sense considering there is plenty of white space.
ROLL UP, ROLL UP.  Show your best and worst implementations for a chance to win this '**;**' rare semicolon.

    def happy_birthday(name='Voldemort'):
        to_whom = (*('to you,', ) * 2, f'dear {name.capitalize()},', 'to you,', *('Hip Hip Hooray!', ) * 3)
        print('\n'.join(f"{'Happy Birthday ' if idx < 4 else ''}{who}" for idx, who in enumerate(to_whom)))
Initially I thought this would not satisfy me on my birthday however having thought about it, code that I can easily explain to someone that it is wrong and how to improve it would definitely be satisfying.. this comment section is a great example of that!
I find your lack of indentation disturbing
Indentation error oof
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to name! Happy birthday to you.  
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to name! Happy birthday to you.  
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to name! Happy birthday to you.  
Hip Hip Hooray!  
Hip Hip Hooray!

Hip Hip Hooray!

Something seems off.
just because it's your birthday you can't throw indentation off the roof...
Python comes with ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù.  Shouldn‚Äôt the cake be:

from birthday_utils import happy_birthday

happy_birthday(‚Äòkookoo‚Äô)
The lack of indentation is hurting my nerves, btw great cake 10/10 would eat
~~the indentation~~
He must be pretty much pissed after he saw that the indentation error!
The syntax highlighting with colors is a really nice touch.
IndentationError: expected an indented block.......
jk this is too cute Happy Birthday!
It's a sin. The code should be in dark mode.
Indention Error at line 6.
I have been trying to teach myself python recently and was actually able to understand what was going on with this cake. This feels like kind of a big deal. I finally get the jokes.
no indentation :(
I find the lack of indentation disturbing ...
indentation Error!
How am I the only person who felt compelled to fix and refactor this? Even the song is off!

	import time

	def happy_birthday(name):
		name = name.title()
		template = "Happy Birthday {}"
		s1 = template.format("to you!")
		s2 = template.format(f"dear {name},")
        song = [s1, s1, s2, s1] + \
               ["Hip Hip, Hooray!"]*3
		for line in song:
			print(line)
			sleep(1)
		
	if __name__ == '__main__'
		happy_birthday('Kookoo')
No indentation buddy
The lack of indentations made my eyes burn
 this is a good idea but disregarding the indentation error it wouldn‚Äôt even sing happy bday in the right order lol
Happy birthday *dear* name, not *to*
# Sorry: IndentationError: ('unindent does not match any outer indentation level', ('[HappyBirthday.py](https://HappyBirthday.py)', 1016, 8, "print('Happy Birthday to you.')))
I am proud of myself for understanding what each component of that does. I just started to teach myself and this was surprisingly a big boost of confidence.

Happy birthday!
Syntax error line 4 expected indent
use f-strings
where is main.  WHERE IS MAIN.
The indentations and the song is not right. üò≠üò≠
You should use play sound module!
I love the thought that went into this. I‚Äôm also concerned at the amount of anxiety the lack of indentation causes me. I‚Äôve been writing Python for far too long...
r/badcode
Oops IndentationError
Sad times about indentation, it's a shame it'll never run but amazing cake !
The thing that hurts more than the missing indentation is that this code isn't using .format()
Indentation error. Nice thought though
This is perfect for me as it is my birthday today on 28th june : the most perfect day of the year as it is made of the first two numbers that exist....
com essa indenta√ß√£o vai fazer o cara fugir... kakakaka
You could save some space using cake.format()
Must be a testers birthday party.
You know it's a geek place when a gag like this get corrected and optimized
Happy...

Expected Indentation, Birthday Invalid
Printer clogged with cake, instructions unclear
If i got anything like this for my bday i would appreaciate it, but it just feels, wrong.
You don't just place code on a bday cake
The lack of indentation is infuriarating. And I really hope there is a dark mode one next to it.
Anybody else concerned about that "frosting". Big yikes.
I would be thrilled!
this needs some monospaced font
PEP 8!
You were suppose to run the .py file and then run it in visual code
find the syntax error
I'm going to invent an icing printer that includes a tab key and revolutionize the baking world.
Use a logger God damnit
Ffs use the logger
The indentation error is hurting my brain
The lack of indentation is killing me
Damn, print does ‚Äò ‚Äò.join() TIL
Your birthday is the day before mine! It's past midnight where I live, but happy birthday anyways.
I am new to programming and being able to understand this script (2) made me so happy :)

Happy birthday to you. And thanks for the great share.
I just started learning python and I‚Äôm stoked that I understood what was happening in this cake! Dope cake as well! (Indentation set to .5mm)
No spaces/new lines  between prints. That's even worse than the indentations!
By giving them bad code!
Noice
Cool idea, but would be better if it ran properly. Get a bigger cake and indent it properly, I say.
Lol I did not know that there was a `.capitalize()` method in python. Makes you wonder what other helpful methods and functions there are that you would probably never know about.
I'd be sitting there, quietly code-reviewing it in my head.
omg how did she do this? i have to do this for my brother lol
God damn the indentation, SYNTAX ERROR. It‚Äôs still nice tho
I really liked the import time part
Not to bash, but does anyone else dislike these pseudo code type things? I just find all of them cheesy I guess idk
The lack of indentation is killing me
Needs a pep8 linter
Everyone goes on about indentation, but a full second sleep in between lines? Where's the rhythm?
Indentation!
>print("Happy Birthday to",name,"!");

There is not space after the **to** :(
You could have chosen other languages. Indentation error will make him cry!!
Everyone talking about indentation, but the real atrocity was committed before a single line was written: **non-monospaced font**. Disgusting!
I'd be soo infuriated with that indentation
dude, the indentation!!

ps: nice cake, happy birthday
Error:
Expected indent at ‚ÄúHappy birthday.py‚Äù in Line 5: ‚Äúdef happy_birthday(name):‚Äù <‚Äî

Otherwise nice cake üéÇ, lets hope there is no more bugs
That's actually so much worse, he'll have to spend some time getting the indentation right. 

Also the .capitalise function is not defined.
The indentation tho
The font isn't mono too! :-(
TABBING!!!! FUCKING TABBING IS INCORRECT!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH. I'm going to have to spam down arrow, home key, and tab!!!!!!




That's what a programmer would think
r/softwaregore
print statement under for loop not indented. So it would cause error and drive the programmer crazy but not satisfied
IndentationError: expected an indented block
Get them f-strings for their next birthday
I think it doesn't work, it doesn't have tabs.
time is the best fucking thing in all of python
More like:

from celebrations import birthday

print(birthday.lyrics(‚ÄòSimon‚Äô))
I need it
I'm so happy to understand this simple code !
Is it a cultural thing somewhere to sing ‚Äúto NAME‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdear NAME‚Äù? I‚Äôm in the US and have always sung the latter
Is NOBODY going to comment on the lack of f-strings?
bd = lambda n="you": print(f"happy birthday to {n}")

hbty = [bd("name") if i==2 else bd() for i in range(4)]
