Now you need machine learning to determine the attractiveness of the picture.
Note: If you swipe right to all the people, the Tinder algorithm is going to deem you as 'desperate', and therefore, not very attractive. And it's going to lower your ranking so you'll get shown less and less to the most attractive people.
Her: “so I’m curious, what made you swipe right?”
Me: “My python”
Her: “oh you’re python, well how big is it?”
Me: “Let’s just say it’s way past 3.6”

Tinder has a web interface? 
You can also do this with an Android phone using the `adb` tool. 

First [download the android debug bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html).
Then [enable your phone to use adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling).

Then plug in your phone and type into a terminal:

    while true; \
    do ./adb shell input touchscreen swipe 300 800 1000 800 100; \
    sleep .$[ ( $RANDOM % 10 ) + 1 ]s; \
    done;

I went through some of the chapters of Automate the Boring Stuff, and I've always used Selenium for stuff like that. Is pyautogui better? 
I did the same thing using adb commands a couple of years ago. This was when there was no concept of Super Likes and daily swipe limits. 

Surprisingly it worked pretty well then, because tinder was new and didn't restrict such "I lswipe right all behavior". These days profiles that swipe everyone right are ranked pretty low. 
I just recreated this program! It never ends, though - do not recommend. 
I know it's fake because you got a match.
I use the pyautogui to automate the login process on the system in wich I work. I like very much! It´s perfect to me.

ps. I´m from Brazil and I´m not english speaker! Sorry for any error
This is great
Well, that's hilarious

I put up a tutorial on youtube and the project on Github.

Could I train a machine learning model based on my swipes as to what kind of pictures I find attractive? I wonder what kind of horrifying image would come out when ran backwards (I don't know machine learning or the term for having it synthesize based on a model)
Ah, the old nuclear bomb approach. 
Al Sweigart would be proud (?)
GUI automation is the least reliable form of automation but it is also the easiest for newcomers to understand and to do. I would encourage people to try GUI automation first but to then move on to using APIs.
I use keyboard macros for gaming that have a similar end-result.
It’s easier and less complicated to do with JS and can be done entirely within the browser.
That's one way to not get matches. 
You are right, Tinder is boring stuff.
Code is not visible, can someone provide the github link ?
This is cool
TIL you can use Tinder on the web
Did you make everyone hot there? 
Brilliant. Could be the hook that gets more millennials into code. 
Might want to put NSFW on this...
I probably won’t get a single match even with this 
Genius.
You can use tinder in a browser? Since when? 
Tell me more about this witchcraft called Pyautogui...
Oh, so that's what it looks like when you get matches.
This is very cool and i just tried it out, but it doesn't seem to like multiple monitors.
Source please
Or, If you own a mac, just use AppleScript: [Download here](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/tinder-swipe-script)
Who can name all those extensions?
This guy Tinders.
Can anyone tell me what this is accomplishing (in the gif)? Just clicking through pictures?

Also, "till a baby" is a terrible username for a dating site IMO.
Isn’t this the same as selenium? 
Very cool. This actually inspired me to write few bots
Interviewer: “Do you have any special skills?”
Me: “I have 20.000 tinder matches”
Cool post
Cool post
Whats your github ?
I tried to do this in selenium. I had no luck finding the tag. I bet this could be used for a lot of other things.
import pyautogui
pyautogui.position() 
import time

while True :

time.sleep(0.5)
pyautogui.click()

#using reddit as a text editor 
##nextlevel

i guess this would work if your goal was to match with a python chat bot

or ugly chicks.
Wow, I'm a bit shocked to see this type of post here. And some of the comments... Yikes!
[removed]
Lol I’m confused why did he pick tinder to demo that? It’s just clicking on the like button right ?
That is great, awesome library tip.

But I have to mention that if you google you'll find services that let you mass swipe people on tinder. I've never used them, might be phishing. But I have seen them.
google garyshood auto clicker, and avoid this stupid python shit lmao
