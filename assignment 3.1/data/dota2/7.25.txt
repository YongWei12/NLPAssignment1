General
	All Pick hero picking has been reworked. It now has 5 rounds, each round Radiant and Dire pick 1 hero each at the same time and the selections each team makes is hidden until the next round. If a duplicate pick occurs, the player who picked it second will be given some extra time to select another hero.
	Reworked how hero banning works in All Pick. Previously half of the voted heroes would get banned. Now each ban has a 50% chance of succeeding. If there are less than 10 heroes banned, heroes will automatically roll for banning based on their ban rate at your MMR bracket.
	Power Runes initially spawn at 4 minutes now (subsequent spawns are still every 2 minutes)
	Power Runes no longer spawn on both sides of the map at 40 minutes
	Removed the team based rubber band mechanic for hero kills (formula reworked and simplified below)
