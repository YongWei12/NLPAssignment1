Abstract

Preliminaries

We apply modern well-known machine learning classifiers to the
problem of determining whether a given positive integer is even or
odd, a problem dating as far back as 6th century Classical Greece
before common era and even further in Ancient Egypt. We prove
that the classification of engendered numbers is possible. This
is done by utilizing a unique dimensionality-reducing encoding
that was implemented before the machine learning models were
trained. Overall, our models‚Äô results proved to be successful in
classification as indicated through AUC and ROC analysis.

Even and Odd

Introduction

In this article, we‚Äôll discuss a partition of numbers discovered by
the Ionian Greek philosopher Pythagoras (c.570‚Äìc.495 BC), which
he discovered during his tenure in Egypt before founding a school
of math in Greece. ‚ÄúTo him, the odd numbers were male, and the
evens were female‚Äù[PYT].
Following Pythagoras, we will restrict our attention from the
usual integers, Z = {..., ‚àí1, 0, 1, ...}, to only the positive integers,
Z+ = {1, 2, 3, ...} ‚äÇ Z. Although one can evaluate whether a
small number is even or odd, the general problem remains open.1
In the following sections, we will formally define even and odd
numbers, build a classifier, evaluate its results in a case study,
discuss potential improvements, and conclude with relevant open
problems.

Definion 1. [MNT] Let n ‚àà Z+ be a positive integer. We say that
n is even iff2 ‚àÉk ‚àà Z such that 2 ¬∑ k = n Similarly, n is odd iff
‚àÉk ‚àà Z such that (2 ¬∑ k) + 1 = n.

For example, 1 = 2 ¬∑ 0 + 1, 3 = 2 ¬∑ 1 + 1, 5 = 2 ¬∑ 2 + 1, 9 =
2 ¬∑ 4 + 1, 7 = 2 ¬∑ 3 + 1 are odd and 2 = 2 ¬∑ 1, 4 = 2¬∑, 6 = 2 ¬∑ 3, 8 =
2 ¬∑ 4, 10 = 2 ¬∑ 5 are even. We have manually classified the next 60
numbers. In the next section, we will use that labeled data to train
a classifier to evaluate the even-ness/odd-ness of a given number.
2.2 Receiver Operating Characteristics [ROC]

This section is pulled directly from the source cited. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graph is a technique for visualizing,
organizing, and selecting classifiers based on their performance.
Definion 2. ROC graphs are two-dimensional graphs in which tp
(true positive) rate is plotted on the Y axis and f p (false positive)
is plotted on the X axis.
They depict relative tradeoffs between benefits (tp) and costs
(f p). We‚Äôll see the tradeoffs in Section 4.

3.Solution

We propose to use real data such as seen in Figure 5 to train machine learning classifies using the Python library scikit-learn.
In particular, we will implement support vector machines (SVM),
multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), decision tree classifiers (DTC), as
shown in Figure 1.
The code is freely available at the first author‚Äôs GitHub repository. [DRECPEN]. All the results achieved in section 4 were performed on a x86-64 Arch Linux Thinkpad running Python 3.7.2.


3.1 Encoding

In particular, we pre-process the information by encoding the positive integer in binary [AB]. We optimized this encoding and reduced its size to a single bit by restricting our data to the rightmost
bit and disregarding the rest of the binary string, since memory becomes a concern when dealing with large numbers. The authors are
not in agreement as to why this yields such accurate results, but
they are proud of its size and speed.

dependent variable and Œª indicates the margin strength for classification.

4.1.2 Evaluation

In our evaluation as seen in Figure 2 ROC analysis indicates a
strong informative model. This is shown as the mean ROC is above
the chance line with a low standard deviation. Furthermore, the
AUC indicates 1.00 leaving us to conclude that it does better than
random chance.

MLP Discussion

MLP models are considered to be a type of deep learning that has
found to be useful in fields such as speech recognition and image
recognition. The model employs layers of neuron that contains the
following ReLU activation function:
f (x) = max(0, x)
Each layer in the neural network contains a number of nodes where
a weight wij was applied at each level to each node.
Learning was then done using back propagation such that:
X 2
ej (n) = dj (n) ‚àí yj (n)(n) = 1/2
ej (n)
j

d is the target value, y is the output of the perceptron.
And gradient descent was then used to optimize the weights:
‚àÜwji (n) = ‚àíŒΩ

4. Case Study: Classification Models


4.1 SVM

4.1.1 Discussion
SVM is a popular machine learning model created by Vapnik
and Chervonenkis in 1963 which has been implemented successfully in areas such as image classification and hand written character recognizition. The SVM method employs to minimize the
equation[SVM]:

Where ŒΩ is the learning rate, vj is the sum of all the nodes input,
yi is the output of the previous neuron[MLP], n is the data point, j
is the position of the outpude node, and e is the error.
4.2.2

Evaluation

In our evaluation as seen in Figure 3 ROC analysis indicates a
strong informative model. This is shown as the mean ROC is above
the chance line with a low standard deviation. Furthermore, the
AUC indicates 1.00 leaving us to conclude that it does better than
random chance.

5.Discussion

The results are truly surprising. They prove that it is possible to
classify numbers as being even or odd, a skill that even intelligent machines such as humans do not acquire naturally nor easily. Perhaps this issue is deeply tied to the fact that numbers, as
Pythagoreas believed, were engendered, and humans often struggle
with evaluating gender while neural networks (e.g. convolutional)
find great success.

6. Conclusion

Although this problem is difficult (perhaps intractable), similar
problems may be solvable. It may be worthwhile to classify prime
numbers, Mersenne primes, perfect numbers, positive numbers,
negative numbers, zero, and powers of two.

Acknowledgements

We would like to thank our colleague, a student at the Washington
Elementary School for classifying the first 70 numbers as even
or odd. This work was partially supported by Spark Tank, who
provided us with coworking space and toiletries. Most importantly,
we would like to thank our families, without which we could have
completed this work 2 years sooner.

DTC

4.3.1 Discussion
DTC is a popular white model method in use cases such as fraud
detection, direct marketing, and economics. More generally we
used a decision tree learning method with the information gain
metric of:
H(T ) = IE (p1 , p2 , ..., pj ) = ‚àíJX
