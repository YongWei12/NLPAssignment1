Abstract
Introduction
Data
is
a
well
studied
topic
with
many
applications
.
However
existing
methods
su↵er
from
several
limitations
In
this
paper
we
introduce
novel
tool
that
takes
advantage
of
powerful
mathematical
theorem
By
leveraging
are
able
perform
absolutely
lossless
any
textual
data
less

original
size
We
conﬁdent
in

implementation
because
relies

learning
and
neural
networks
which
sufficiently
sophisticated
ensure
complete
accuracy
